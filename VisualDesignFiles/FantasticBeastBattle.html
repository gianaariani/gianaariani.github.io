<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;">This image shows a couple animals combined together. For the tiger looking thing, I decided to make it all white so I used animals that were all white or mainly white. The first animal I chose was a White Tiger. Then I decided I wanted it to fly so I gave it dove wings. For the last animal I chose a ghost moose. Which is just a white moose. For all my animals I was expected to cut out whatever parts I wanted to use. Therefore I cut out the tigers head, the doves wings and the mooseâ€™s body using the object selection tool. I then copied and pasted all those items onto a new layer. Once everything was cut out I started to combine my animal parts to form an animal. I used many different tools to do this. Tools like rotate and scale. Then I switched around the layers to make the animal look a little more natural and I used the blur tool to mesh the animal parts together. When I was done I merged the layers and repeated the next process for my second animal. Which is a sand cat and a red fox with hummingbird wings. Then I added the background and positioned them to how I wanted them to look.I would say my tiger animal can fly and attack other animals just like a tiger would but it just cant run as fast as a normal tiger would. For my second animal, I would say that the sand cat is really good at running really fast and really good at being able to hide in small places. Which benefits them a lot as being a prey animal.</div>
