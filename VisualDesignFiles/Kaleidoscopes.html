	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	<p>	My original image was rice. I choose rice because it's one of my favorite thanksgiving foods. I originally wanted to do mac and cheese but I couldn't find it. I choose to do red to show a different color and black to try and make the original image look different.The rest of the adjustments, I just put random ones so I don't really remember. I made the original image first and then I cropped it and took many copies of it and continued to rotate it all around the canvas to make it look like a kaleidoscope.
