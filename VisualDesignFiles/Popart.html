<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	
	<p>	I choose this image out of the other 3 because it's my favorite out of all of them. I like the colors used. I feel like they just go together and make the picture really pop. When making this project I was inspired by the comic type pop art pictures. The popular ones that you see with celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and different superheroes like WonderWoman. I wanted to do the same thing but with my picture instead. I wanted to use more Neon like colors, bright pinks,yellows,blues and greens. To turn my photos like this i had to mess with colors and invert the colors and then add all of my different neon colors. Then once that was done I went through and I added all my pictures in one and merged the layers to all become one.</p>
