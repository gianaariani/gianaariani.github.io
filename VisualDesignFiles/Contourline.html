<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	
	<p>	The photo I used was a photo of myself. It took many times to get that photo because I kept taking pictures and not liking them. The first step I took was to take the picture. I then inserted them into photoshop. Once in photoshop I used the freeform pen tool in order to trace and outline my face. Once that was done, I deleted my background layer and then merged all the rest of my layers together.  Then I went on to google images and grabbed a picture of a sage green color and added that into photoshop as well. I then added my text and moved the layers so it was in the background. Then I erased the text so it wasn't in my face and then I was done. The text I used was my first and middle name because that's what I use for everything.
