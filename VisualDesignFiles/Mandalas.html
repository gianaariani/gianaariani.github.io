<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
	
	<p>	The original shape was a flower. I chose this flower because I thought it looked pretty and I wanted to make it pink. The colors I chose were pastel because I wanted my design to be more pastel then the first one I made. The process wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It took less time than the first one.</p>
